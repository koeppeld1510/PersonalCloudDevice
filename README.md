# PersonalCloudDevice
Repository for system controller and web application code. May possibly add windows service if time permits.

This repository will consist of at least two folders. One will contain all the controller code for memory management and other
embedded code required for the proper functioning of the processor. The other will contain all of the web application code,
including css, html, and script files. If time permits, we may add a windows installer file which will allow the client machine
to locally host a folder synchronized to the device's external storage.
